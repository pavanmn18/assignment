# Assignment

Help us write automation to test the URL that will be shared with you. 

Automation can be written in a framework of your choice. You would push the code to your github repo and share the link once its complete. We would like to see your commits that show progression and thought process as to how you are completing the exercise. 

Things that you will be evaluated on:

1.	Functional code
2.	Code quality
3.	Code comments, readme docs

Assumptions you can make:
1.	This is a uni-directional flow with no testing required for back button functionality.


All the best!
