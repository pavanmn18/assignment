# Assignment

There are various files - structured and unstructured that will be shared with you. Your objective is to write a program that will cleanse, parse and normalize the data for a PDF or excel file that will be passed to it.

You will be given a couple of sample files and you will write code to extract data out of them. 

You can build this with a technology stack that you are comfortable with. You would push the code to your github repo and share the link once its complete. We would like to see your commits that show progression and thought process as to how you are completing the exercise. 

Things that you will be evaluated on:

1.	Functional code
2.	Code quality
3.	Code comments, readme docs

All the best!
